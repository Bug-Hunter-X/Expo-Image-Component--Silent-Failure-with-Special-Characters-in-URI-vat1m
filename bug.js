This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a URI that contains special characters, such as spaces or accented characters. The image fails to load, and no error is thrown in the console.  This is particularly problematic when working with dynamic URIs generated by APIs or user input.  The issue might be related to how Expo handles URI encoding within its image loading mechanism. For example, if you have an image URI like `https://example.com/image with space.jpg`, the `Image` component might fail silently.
